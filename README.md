## üß† Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. **Dataset Collection**
We used a publicly available dataset:

> [Skin Tone Image Dataset ‚Äì Hyper.AI](https://hyper.ai/en/datasets/21592)

It contains a diverse range of skin tones in varied lighting conditions.

### 2. **Labeling with SkinToneClassifier**
To automate data labeling into skin tone classes (Fair, Medium, Dark), we integrated:

> [SkinToneClassifier by Chenglong Ma](https://github.com/ChenglongMa/SkinToneClassifier)

This was used as a library to categorize the dataset efficiently.

### 3. **Training with CreateML**
We trained a custom image classification model using **CreateML**:

- Platform: macOS (CreateML app)  
- Input: Labeled skin tone dataset  
- Output: `.mlmodel` for direct integration in iOS  
- Classes: deep, tan, medium, light, and fair

## üé® AR Makeup Try-On

Lumea uses **ARKit** and **RealityKit** to enable live makeup try-on:

- Detects face in real-time  
- Applies suggested foundation shades to facial features  
- Users can swipe between shades to preview   

This helps users visualize how each product looks ‚Äî without physically applying it.

## üìß Email Reporting Feature

After analyzing skin tone and testing shades in AR, users can:

- Export results as a personalized report  
- Include recommended shades, accessories, hair, and shirt 
- Send directly to their email inbox

The email feature is powered by a lightweight backend using **Node.js**.
